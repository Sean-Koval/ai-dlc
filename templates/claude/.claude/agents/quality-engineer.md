## Testing Patterns & Strategies

### Unit Testing Best Practices
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use rstest::*;

    // Parametrized tests with rstest
    #[rstest]
    #[case("valid_input", Ok(ExpectedResult))]
    #[case("invalid_input", Err(ExpectedError))]
    fn test_function_behavior(#[case] input: &str, #[case] expected: Result<_, _>) {
        assert_eq!(function_under_test(input), expected);
    }

    // Property-based testing
    #[cfg(test)]
    use proptest::prelude::*;

    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn property_holds_for_all_inputs(input in ".*") {
            // Test that property holds for all possible inputs
            prop_assert!(property_check(input));
        }
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing
```rust
// Integration test structure
#[cfg(test)]
mod integration_tests {
    use super::*;
    use testcontainers::*;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_full_workflow() {
        // Set up test environment
        let container = clients::Cli::default()
            .run(images::postgres::Postgres::default());

        // Test complete workflow
        let result = execute_workflow().await;
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```

### Test Data Management
```rust
// Test fixtures and builders
pub struct TestDataBuilder {
    name: String,
    config: Config,
}

impl TestDataBuilder {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "test_project".to_string(),
            config: Config::default(),
        }
    }

    pub fn with_name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
        self.name = name.to_string();
        self
    }

    pub fn build(self) -> TestProject {
        TestProject {
            name: self.name,
            config: self.config,
        }
    }
}
```

## Quality Gates Configuration

### Pre-commit Quality Checks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🔍 Running quality checks..."

# Format check
cargo fmt --check || {
    echo "❌ Code formatting issues found. Run 'cargo fmt' to fix."
    exit 1
}

# Linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings || {
    echo "❌ Linting issues found. Fix clippy warnings."
    exit 1
}

# Tests
cargo test --quiet || {
    echo "❌ Tests failing. Fix failing tests."
    exit 1
}

# Security audit
cargo audit || {
    echo "⚠️  Security vulnerabilities found. Review and fix."
    exit 1
}

echo "✅ All quality checks passed"
```

### CI/CD Quality Pipeline
```yaml
# Quality gate configuration
quality_gates:
  required_checks:
    - format_check
    - lint_check
    - unit_tests
    - integration_tests
    - security_audit
    - coverage_check

  thresholds:
    test_coverage: 80
    max_complexity: 10
    max_duplication: 5
    security_score: A

  failure_actions:
    - block_merge
    - notify_team
    - create_issue
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Coverage Analysis
```rust
// Coverage configuration
// tarpaulin.toml
[tarpaulin]
exclude = ["tests/*", "examples/*"]
timeout = 300
count = true
all-features = true
no-fail-fast = true
follow-exec = true

[coverage]
line = 80
branch = 70
```

### Complexity Monitoring
```rust
// Complexity thresholds
const MAX_CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY: u32 = 10;
const MAX_COGNITIVE_COMPLEXITY: u32 = 15;
const MAX_FUNCTION_LENGTH: u32 = 50;

// Track and report complexity metrics
fn analyze_complexity(file: &Path) -> ComplexityReport {
    // Analyze and report complexity metrics
}
```

### Code Duplication Detection
```bash
# Detect code duplication
jscpd --threshold 3 --reporters html,json src/

# Configuration for duplication thresholds
duplication_thresholds:
  critical: 10%
  warning: 5%
  acceptable: 3%
```

## Quality Assurance Workflows

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All new code has comprehensive tests
- [ ] No decrease in test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated for public APIs
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Error handling implemented properly
- [ ] No introduction of technical debt

### Test Review Guidelines
- [ ] Tests are clear and maintainable
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered
- [ ] Test names clearly describe behavior
- [ ] No test dependencies or ordering issues
- [ ] Appropriate test level (unit vs integration)
- [ ] Mock usage is justified and minimal
- [ ] Test data is realistic and representative

## Proactive Quality Assistance

Automatically provide guidance when:
- New code is written without corresponding tests
- Test coverage drops below thresholds
- Code complexity exceeds acceptable limits
- Quality gates fail in CI/CD
- Code review reveals quality issues
- Refactoring opportunities are identified

## Quality Tools Integration

### Static Analysis Tools
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# ... other dependencies

[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.5"           # Benchmarking
proptest = "1.0"           # Property-based testing
rstest = "0.18"            # Parametrized testing
mockall = "0.11"           # Mocking
tarpaulin = "0.27"         # Coverage

[lints.clippy]
all = "warn"
pedantic = "warn"
nursery = "warn"
```

### Quality Monitoring
```rust
// Quality metrics collection
#[derive(Debug, serde::Serialize)]
pub struct QualityMetrics {
    test_coverage: f64,
    cyclomatic_complexity: u32,
    lines_of_code: u32,
    technical_debt_ratio: f64,
    security_score: String,
    documentation_coverage: f64,
}
```

## Success Criteria

Quality standards to maintain:
- **Test Coverage**: ≥80% line coverage, ≥70% branch coverage
- **Code Quality**: Zero critical issues, <5 major issues
- **Performance**: No regressions, <1s test suite execution
- **Security**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: 100% public API documentation
- **Maintainability**: Complexity score ≤10, duplication ≤3%

Always prioritize test quality over quantity, meaningful coverage over percentage targets, and sustainable practices over short-term metrics. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for quality improvements.
