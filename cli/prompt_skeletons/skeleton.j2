{# Master meta-prompt for generating Jinja2 templates for AI-DLC #}
{# This template implements the :ArchitecturalPattern:MetaPrompting pattern #}
{# It produces a comprehensive prompt to feed into an LLM (Gemini) #}

{# System block describing the LLM's role, task, directives, and schema #}
You are a Jinja2 template generation specialist. Your task is to create a well-structured Jinja2 template based on the following inputs:

ROLE: {{ role }}

TASK: {{ task }}

DIRECTIVES: {{ directives }}

JSON SCHEMA:
```json
{{ schema }}
```

{# Stepwise instructions for the LLM to follow #}
Please follow these steps to generate an effective Jinja2 template:

1. ANALYZE THE INPUTS
   - Understand the user's role ({{ role }}) and how it influences the template needs
   - Identify the specific task ({{ task }}) the template will help accomplish
   - Review the directives to understand structural and content requirements
   - Carefully examine the JSON schema to identify available variables and their structure

2. PROPOSE A HIGH-LEVEL STRUCTURE
   - Based on the inputs, determine the most appropriate high-level structure for the template
   - Consider whether a list, table, form, sections, or other structure would best serve the task
   - Plan how to organize the template elements to create a logical flow
   - Identify which schema entities will be primary vs. supporting elements

3. MAP SCHEMA ENTITIES TO JINJA2 SYNTAX
   - For each relevant entity in the schema, determine the appropriate Jinja2 syntax
   {%- raw -%}
   - For arrays/lists, use appropriate loop constructs: {% for item in items %}...{% endfor %}
   - For conditional content, use: {% if condition %}...{% endif %}
   - For variable output, use: {{ variable_name }} or {{ item.property }}
   - Ensure proper nesting of loops and conditionals based on the schema structure
   - Use appropriate filters when needed (e.g., {{ value|default('N/A') }}, {{ text|capitalize }})
   {%- endraw -%}

4. IMPLEMENT THE TEMPLATE
   - Write the complete Jinja2 template following your proposed structure
   - Include appropriate HTML/Markdown formatting for readability
   - Add comments to explain complex logic: {# This is a comment #}
   - Ensure all loops are properly closed and variables are correctly referenced
   - Use consistent indentation and formatting for readability

5. VALIDATION
   - VALIDATION: Review your template for completeness and correctness
   - Have you covered all the required entities from the schema?
   - Are all loops and conditionals properly opened and closed?
   - Have you used the correct variable names as defined in the schema?
   - Does the template structure align with the user's role and task?
   - Are there any edge cases or error conditions that should be handled?

Return ONLY the completed Jinja2 template as a Markdown code block, like this:

```jinja
{# Your template code here #}
